6 kyu
A disguised sequence (I)

Given u0 = 1, u1 = 2 and the relation 6unun+1-5unun+2+un+1un+2 = 0 calculate un for any integer n >= 0.

Examples:
Call fcn the function such as fcn(n) = un.

fcn(17) -> 131072; fcn(21) -> 2097152

Remark:
You can take two points of view to do this kata:

the first one purely algorithmic from the definition of un

the second one - not at all mandatory, but as a complement - is to get a bit your head around and find which sequence is hidden behind un.

p fcn(17) # == 131072
# fcn(21) == 2097152
# fcn(14) == 16384
# fcn(43) == 8796093022208
# fcn(19) == 524288
